# Skeleton Java App

This repository contains an empty Gradle (Java) project as a springboard. 

## Instructions

1. Please load up the project in your IDE of choice, make sure its downloaded dependencies and you can create and compile a basic Java class. 
2. Once happy, fork this repository within Github and share your fork with us.

We'll work on fork with a skeleton application to extend / play with together. We'll ask you during the session to merge our changes then go from there!
